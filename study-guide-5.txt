Week 5 Study Guide

Critical Topics from This Week


SQLAlchemy
What is an ORM?
- object-relational mapping
- A tool used to manage/convert database data from an object-oriented programming perspective.
- DB table => Classes
- DB fields => Attributes

How to define and create new tables in SQLAlchemy
- class Cat(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'cats'
    cat_id = db.Column(db.Integer,
                       primary_key=True,
                       autoincrement=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False, unique=True)

SQLAlchemy methods to know
- .filter() : Cat.query.filter(Cat.color == 'grey').all()
- .filter_by() : Cat.query.filter_by(color='grey').all()
- .all(), .one(), .first() : Add to a query to fetch records

JOINs in SQLAlchemy
- .join(other table)

Relationships in SQLAlchemy
- cat_food = db.relationahiop('CatFood')
- Allows SQLAlchemy to navigate relationship between 2 databases with a primary/foreign key relationship.

What is the purpose of a backref in SQLAlchemy?
- Shortcut so you only have to declare one relationship.


Data Modeling
Types of relationships
- One-to-many: one breed has many cats
- One-to-one: one cat has one collar
- Many-to-many: one cat has many toys, and one toy can belong to many cats

Association tables, middle tables
- Association tables have no meaningful fields. They are simply the glue between two many-to-many tables.
- Middle tables have meaningful fields.

How to draw data model diagrams

What is data normalization?
- Make sure data models don't repeat dependencies and that they don't represent multiple data for the same category in columns.
- Every piece of information lives in exactly one place and relates directly to the key.

What is referential integrity?
- It ensures the relationships between tables in a database remain accurate by applying constraints to prevent users or apps from entering inaccurate data or pointing to data that doesn't exist.
- It prevents id from 1st table from being in 2nd table but not in the first, and from deleting 1st table if id is in 2nd table.


Debugging
Debugging tools to know
- Using pdb
- The Flask debug toolbar
- Using Flask error pages (and the console button)
- Judiciously placed print statements
- Using raise Exception('Huh?') to see if you got to a particular place


Bootstrap
What is Twitter bootstrap? What is the grid system?
- 

How can you use the grid system to set sizes for HTML elements depending on whether the screen is a mobile phone, iPad, or monitor/laptop?
- 

Other boostrap concepts to know
- Making and customizing a navbar
- How to integrate bootstrap components like buttons and cards
- How to override bootstrap styles


Web Patterns
When should you use AJAX? When shouldnâ€™t you use AJAX?
- USE: check for updates every 30 seconds, infinite scroll, send POST request but stay on page (add to cart but stay on page), get data once page initially loads
- DON'T USE: intercept form to make sure it's properly filled out (JS), submit a form in JS when something happens (click away)

What are various ways to get data from the front-end of a web app to the back-end? 
- Using JavaScript?
- Without using JavaScript? GET and POST
